## 🌟 Mission & Inspiration

This project is not just a website; it is an extension of the church's ministry. Our goal is to create a digital experience that reflects the warmth, excellence, and life-changing message of the Gospel.

**Inspired by [Elevation Church](https://elevationchurch.org/)**, we prioritized:
*   **Visual Impact**: High-quality imagery and clean typography.
*   **Intuitive Navigation**: A simplified, visitor-centric menu structure (Left Drawer + Right Actions).
*   **Engagement**: Removing barriers to "Watch", "Give", and "Plan a Visit".

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Modern "Elevation-Style" Navigation
We implemented a custom navigation system that mimics the best-in-class church experience:
*   **Dynamic Header**: Transparent on hero, white on scroll.
*   **Action-Oriented**: "New Here", "Watch", and "Give" are always one click away.
*   **Full-Screen Menu**: A smooth, slide-out drawer for deep navigation ("Get Involved", "Discover").

### 2. Digital Sermon Library (`/sermons`)
A Netflix-style experience for the Word:
*   **Searchable**: Filter by Series, Speaker, or Topic.
*   **Metadata Rich**: Date, scripture reference, and duration visibility.

### 3. Interactive Events Calendar (`/events`)
Keeping the body connected:
*   **Month-Grouped View**: Easy scanning of upcoming activities.
*   **Digital Integration**: "Add to Calendar" functionality for Google/Apple users.

### 4. Ministry Directory (`/ministries`)
Helping members find their tribe:
*   **Categorized**: Kids, Youth, Men, Women, Outreach.
*   **Visual Cards**: Engaging previews of each group.

### 5. Secure Giving Portal (`/give`)
Making generosity simple and trustworthy:
*   **Clear Options**: Recurring, One-Time, and Mission-specific giving.
*   **Privacy Focused**: Bank-grade security assurance UI.
